Hamlet
======

A work in progress.  The eventual goal is to produce a mechanism by which we can use operant conditioning to train the infinite monkeys to generate *Hamlet* in a more timely manner.  Currently, that means investigation into what it means to be "similar to *Hamlet,*" such as implementing the Metaphone phonetic algorithm.

Future work: typewriter input, banana vending.
